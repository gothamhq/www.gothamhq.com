- organization/start up model


It's my pleasure to introduce to the world our static site generator (SSG), Gotham!
The web is constantly becoming more advanced and we believe in tools that keep up with modern technology and use cases.
Gotham is an open source SSG that is low level enough for developers, flexible enough for power users, yet is intuitive and feature baked for marketers, bloggers, and more.
You can [download it now][gth-dl] or continue learning more below.

## The Past

Gotham wasn't written from scratch.
There's no way we could have such a great project built so fast if we did.
Instead, Gotham is a backwards compatible soft fork of [Hugo][hugo].
We started with the feature and performance DNA of Hugo, layering on brand new features, including low hanging fruit that make users smile, and am building a suite of related tools and resources around it.

We're excited for the opportunity to show you our take on the modern static site generator.


## The Present

Today we have Gotham v0.10.0 which was released 2 days ago.
